Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It involves applying engineering principles to create software solutions that are reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain
Importance-It ensures that the programs we use daily—like apps, websites, and systems—are safe, secure, and user-friendly.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Programming Languages (1950s): Early computers used machine language, but with the creation of higher-level programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL, software development became easier.
2. Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): This introduced a more organized way to write programs, reducing errors and improving maintenance.
3. Agile Methodology (2000s): This revolutionized how teams develop software by focusing on flexibility, customer feedback, and iterative development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: This involves Identifying the needs and goals of the software.
2. Design: Planning the structure of the software (e.g., database, user interface).
3. Implementation: Writing the actual code to build the software.
4. Testing: Ensuring the software works as expected without bugs.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
6. Maintenance: Fixing issues and updating the software over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: A step-by-step approach where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. This is useful for projects with well-defined requirements, such as building a bridge, where changes mid-project would be costly.

Agile: A flexible, iterative approach where development happens in short cycles called "sprints." Feedback is incorporated continuously. This is best for projects like mobile apps, where customer needs might change frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: Writes code, designs algorithms, and creates software applications.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests the software to ensure it's free of bugs and meets the requirements.
3. Project Manager: Oversees the entire project, ensuring that it stays on schedule, within budget, and meets the team's goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Tools like Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA help developers write and debug code more efficiently by providing features like code completion, error highlighting, and debugging tools.
VCS: Systems like Git and GitHub allow multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work. They also keep track of changes, making it easy to revert to a previous version if needed

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges
1: Managing Complexity: Software can become very complex as more features are added.
Strategy: Break the software into smaller, manageable modules and use proper documentation.
 2: Handling Bugs: Bugs can cause unexpected problems.
Strategy: Thorough testing and using automated testing tools help catch bugs early.
3: Keeping Up with Technology: Technology evolves quickly.
Strategy: Regular learning and adapting to new tools and practices are

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual pieces of code (like functions or methods) to ensure they work correctly.
Integration Testing: Ensures that different modules of the software work together as expected.
System Testing: Verifies that the entire system works as intended.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software meets the user's needs and requirements before it is officially released.



Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of designing precise and clear inputs (prompts) that help an AI model generate accurate and useful outputs. It plays a key role in interacting with AI models like GPT because the quality of the output often depends on how well the input is phrased.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Show me how to prepare for an interview
Improved prompt: I am a data science specialist applying for a managerial role at a big farm company in Nairobi.What are the top 10 questions I should expect during the interview and what are the answers expected 

The improved prompt is more effective as it gives you beneficial and more customized answers
